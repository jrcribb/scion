## 2. Inconsistencies and Edge Cases

### 2.1 Design-to-Implementation Gaps

#### 2.1.1 Agent State Machine
**Design:** `hosted-architecture.md` defines agent states: `pending`, `provisioning`, `running`, `paused`, `stopping`, `stopped`, `failed`, `terminated`

**Implementation:** `pkg/store/models.go` defines: `pending`, `provisioning`, `running`, `paused`, `stopping`, `stopped`, `failed`

**Gap:** Missing `terminated` state. Need to clarify the distinction between `stopped` and `terminated` (permanent vs. restartable).

**Recommendation:** Add `terminated` state for agents that have been explicitly deleted or reached a non-recoverable end state.

#### 2.1.2 Control Channel
**Design:** `hosted-architecture.md` specifies WebSocket-based control channel for Hub-to-Host communication, essential for NAT traversal.

**Implementation:** No WebSocket handlers in `pkg/hub/` or `pkg/runtimebroker/`.

**Gap:** Remote runtime brokers behind NAT cannot receive commands from Hub.

**Recommendation:** Implement control channel as high priority for multi-host deployments.

#### 2.1.3 Agent Dispatcher
**Design:** Hub API should dispatch create/start/stop requests to appropriate Runtime Broker.

**Implementation:** `pkg/hub/server.go` defines `AgentDispatcher` interface with `DispatchAgentCreate` method. `cmd/server.go` implements a local dispatcher adapter.

**Gap:** Dispatcher only works for co-located Hub+Host. No remote dispatch capability.

**Recommendation:** Implement HTTP-based dispatcher for direct reachability, WebSocket for NAT traversal.

### 2.2 Edge Case Concerns

#### 2.2.1 Concurrent Agent Operations
**Risk:** Multiple clients issuing start/stop commands simultaneously.

**Current State:** No explicit locking or transaction isolation for agent state transitions.

**Recommendation:**
- Add optimistic concurrency control via version/ETag on agent records
- Implement state transition validation (e.g., can't start an already-running agent)
- Return 409 Conflict for invalid state transitions

#### 2.2.2 Grove Registration Race Conditions
**Risk:** Multiple hosts registering the same grove URL simultaneously.

**Current State:** SQLite unique constraint will reject duplicates, but error handling may be inconsistent.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement upsert semantics for grove registration
- Return existing grove ID if already registered
- Add contributor relationship atomically

#### 2.2.3 Orphaned Agents on Host Crash
**Risk:** Runtime host crashes with running agents; Hub still shows them as `running`.

**Current State:** No heartbeat or health check mechanism.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement host heartbeat (periodic ping to Hub)
- Mark agents as `unknown` after heartbeat timeout
- Provide reconciliation endpoint for host restart

#### 2.2.4 Secret Scope Resolution
**Risk:** Ambiguous precedence when same secret key exists at multiple scopes.

**Current State:** Design specifies User > Grove > RuntimeBroker precedence but implementation unclear.

**Recommendation:**
- Document scope resolution order explicitly in API
- Implement `GetResolvedSecrets(userID, groveID, hostID)` method
- Return scope source in response for debugging

#### 2.2.5 Environment Variable Expansion
**Risk:** Circular references in environment variables (e.g., `A=$B`, `B=$A`).

**Current State:** No expansion logic implemented.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement expansion at injection time (agent start)
- Detect cycles and fail with clear error
- Limit expansion depth

#### 2.2.6 Template Validation
**Risk:** Invalid container image references in templates.

**Current State:** Templates store image names without validation.

**Recommendation:**
- Validate image name format on create/update
- Consider optional image pull verification
- Add template testing endpoint

#### 2.2.7 Database Connection Limits
**Risk:** SQLite connection exhaustion under load.

**Current State:** Single SQLite file with default connection handling.

**Recommendation:**
- Configure connection pool limits
- Add database health check endpoint
- Consider WAL mode for better concurrency

### 2.3 Security Considerations

#### 2.3.1 Dev Auth in Production
**Risk:** Dev auth token accepted in production.

**Current State:** `dev-auth.md` acknowledges this, but no environment-based disable.

**Recommendation:**
- Add explicit `SCION_DISABLE_DEV_AUTH=true` for production
- Log warnings when dev auth is active
- Document production auth requirements

#### 2.3.2 Secret Storage
**Risk:** Secrets stored in plaintext in SQLite.

**Current State:** Secrets stored as-is in database.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement at-rest encryption for secrets
- Consider external secret store integration (Vault, cloud KMS)
- Add secret rotation support

#### 2.3.3 API Rate Limiting
**Risk:** DoS via excessive API requests.

**Current State:** No rate limiting implemented.

**Recommendation:**
- Add per-user rate limiting
- Implement backoff for failed auth attempts
- Add circuit breaker for downstream services

## 4. Recommended Immediate Actions

1. **Agent State Transitions** - Add validation to prevent invalid state changes (e.g., starting already-running agent).

2. **Host Heartbeat** - Implement basic heartbeat to detect host disconnection and stale agent states.

3. **Error Response Consistency** - Standardize error format across all API endpoints.

4. **Frontend M3** - Complete Grove Management to enable basic registration workflow.

5. **PTY Attach Handler** - Implement actual PTY relay to enable agent interaction.

These five items address the most critical gaps between "system that compiles" and "system that's usable for agent lifecycle management."

## 5. Architecture Validation Notes

### What's Working Well

1. **Grove-Centric Design** - The decision to register groves (projects) rather than hosts simplifies the mental model and matches developer workflows.

2. **Store Abstraction** - Clean separation between store interface and SQLite implementation allows future database swaps.

3. **Client Libraries** - Well-structured clients with service pattern makes CLI and frontend development straightforward.

4. **Dev Auth** - Practical approach for local development without auth complexity.

5. **Middleware Architecture** - Both Go servers and Koa frontend use composable middleware.

### Areas Needing Attention

1. **Real-time Updates** - The design mentions NATS and SSE but neither is implemented. This is critical for responsive UI.

2. **Agent Lifecycle Events** - No event sourcing or history. Consider adding an events table for debugging.

3. **Multi-tenancy** - User scoping exists but enforcement in queries needs review.

4. **Testing** - Testing walkthroughs exist but automated test coverage needs expansion.
