title: Interactive Sessions with Tmux
description: Learn how to use and customize the built-in tmux session management in Scion.
---

Scion uses [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux), a terminal multiplexer, as the default and mandatory shell wrapper for all agent sessions. This ensures that every interactive session is persistent, collaborative, and consistent across all runtimes (Docker, Apple Virtualization, Kubernetes, etc.).

## Why Tmux?

Tmux is automatically started inside every Scion agent. This provides several critical features:

1.  **Session Persistence**: You can detach from an agent session without stopping the underlying process. If your terminal connection drops, the agent keeps working.
2.  **Reliable Attachment**: `scion attach <agent-name>` always connects you to the same persistent shell session.
3.  **Live Collaboration**: Multiple users can run `scion attach` for the same agent simultaneously. Everyone sees the same screen and can type together, creating a built-in pair-programming environment.

## Basic Operations

When you are attached to an agent, you interact with `tmux` using a **prefix key** (Default: `Ctrl-b`).

| Action | Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Detach from Session** | `Prefix` then `d` |
| **Enter Scroll Mode** | `Prefix` then `[` (use arrow keys, `q` to exit) |
| **Split Vertically** | `Prefix` then `%` |
| **Split Horizontally** | `Prefix` then `"` |
| **Switch Panes** | `Prefix` then `Arrow Keys` |

## Customizing Your Session

Each agent's `tmux` behavior is controlled by a `.tmux.conf` file in its home directory. This file is seeded from your project's template.

### Changing Settings for New Agents

To change the default `tmux` configuration for all **new** agents in a project, modify the template file:
`.scion/templates/default/home/.tmux.conf`

### Solving Nested Sessions (Google Cloud Shell)

If you are running Scion inside another `tmux` session (such as in **Google Cloud Shell** or your own local `tmux`), the default `Ctrl-b` prefix will be intercepted by your "outer" session.

To use a different prefix (like `Ctrl-a`) for your Scion agents, add the following to your `.tmux.conf` template:

```tmux
# Set prefix to Ctrl-a
set -g prefix C-a
unbind C-b
bind C-a send-prefix
```

After updating the template, any new agents you create will use `Ctrl-a` as their prefix, allowing you to use `Ctrl-b` for your host session and `Ctrl-a` for the Scion agent session.

## Configuration Reference

While `tmux` is now mandatory, you may still see `tmux: true` in legacy `settings.yaml` files. This setting is now effectively ignored as the orchestrator always wraps sessions in `tmux`.
